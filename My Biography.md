Hi, im Erhan GÖKÇE 
I'm high school student (16 years old)
I teach robotics coding
I am a web developer, I am an expert in cyber security and robotic coding, 
but these skills are insufficient for a better future, so I want to start a career in web development and study computer engineering.

life is short, time is precious..
